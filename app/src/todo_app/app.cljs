; This is a client-only application for TODO list. It has a single text entry 
; with button for entering new todos, and a list of all the entered values.
;
; I based this on two examples from pedestal: helloworld-app and chat. I think
; it's more relevant than helloworld, and much easier to grasp than chat. And it
; has actual comments to explain what is where!
;
; Here's the flow: When the button is clicked, event handler pushes a message to
; :todo topic. There is a transform listening on that topic which updates the 
; data model. There also is an emitter that will push the current list of todos
; up to application model. Finally, in the application level there is a renderer
; that will rebuild part of the page with the current model.
;
; Watch out - this one namespace has things that are in data model and 
; application model, as well as all transforms/dataflows/renders between those 
; models and DOM. Be careful and make sure you understand which model is 
; operated where.
